# JWC3
Retera's Java WC3 libraries.

Before using this repository, you should be aware that other similar repos
such as the following exist:
https://github.com/OgerLord/WcDataLibrary

And, in fact, this repo contains older versions of the code found at the above
link, repackaged and then modified to convert from OgreLord's MDX classes into
my old MDL classes that I wrote back in high school.

So, basically, this repo in its current state is one step in a much larger
process -- the sharing of code -- in which one central Warcraft Modding Data
repo should eventually come in to being, so that independent authors
don't do silly things (like me!) by copying other peoples'
code repackaged and outdated.

# Contents

HayatesCharacterEngine
This is a program written based on a concept drawing from Hayate, suggesting
a program that could create new unit models in only a few clicks.
It is not finished, but can produce models that work and look interesting
in some cases.

JWC3
This is a bunch of Warcraft-related libraries gathered together.

JWorldEdit
This was a basic start on a Warcraft III world editor implementation
in Java. It's not too far along, but contains some interesting code.

JWC3-MatrixEater
This is an implementation of the Matrix Eater 3D modeling software
that relies on both the JWC3 project and on the JWorldEdit project.
